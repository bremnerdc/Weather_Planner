**Homework due April 11th**

## What it does
* The weather dashboard connects to the OpenWeather API and allows the user to search for a zipcode, city, state or even a country and get the current weather and the 5-day forecast of that area. It saves recent searches in local storage and displays them on a sidebar on the left so the user can easily search again.
